					Whether you sip on a fresh, hot coffee or a cooling smoothie, you never need to feel rushed - relax with friends or just watch the world go by.
				</p>
			<h2>This weekend's special brunch</h2>
				<p>
					This weekend, our season of special brunches continues with scrambled egg on an English muffin. Not for the faint-hearted, the secret to these eggs is that they are made with half cream and cooked in butter, with no more than four eggs in the pan at a time.
